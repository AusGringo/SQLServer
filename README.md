SQL Server Tools
=========

These are various SQL Server files that have useful code to solve various problems, formatting, or mystery-helping.  These would be useful for data scientists, developers and those with an interest in SQLServer.

In many cases, these tools can be expanded or tailored for individual or business need.

UPDATE NOTES: Currently I haven't found a friendly app that allows me to change or add SQL files (email me if you know of any).  Many of the apps I've tried, don't allow me to add files (even using the command lines).  I'll continue testing apps, but if I don't find any, I'll use remote login.
