SQL Server Tools
=========

These are various SQL Server files that have useful code to solve various problems, formatting, or mystery-helping.  These would be useful for data scientists, developers and those with an interest in SQLServer.

In many cases, these tools can be expanded or tailored for individual or business need.

NOTE: Eventually, this should have different folders as SQLServer has tools for developers, administrators, analysts and front end programmers.
