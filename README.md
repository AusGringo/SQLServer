SQL Server Tools
=========

These are various SQL Server files that have useful code to solve various problems, formatting, or mystery-helping.  These would be useful for data scientists, developers and those with an interest in SQLServer.

These files also include folders that I use in SQL Server classes to teach data science.

**Note:**

Some code will now be private for followers only on a Google Drive.  To have access to this code, follow me on GitHub, send me an email with the subject of "Follow" with an email that also shows on your GitHub profile, and you'll be added to the private Google Drive repository.  When GitHub allows this feature to reward followers, this repository will move back to GitHub.  Thanks!
